## Motivation
<p>
Money is the main thing that all humanity shares and interested in, so we want to make it easy to be controlled, more secure, and fast for any person and protect its privacy. All that just in one click. Most people who use cash could put them in danger of mugging. They are also afraid of using finance technology because it's difficult to use and it could have several problems and insecurity that lead to fraud.
